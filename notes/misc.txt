debugging higher order functions
(start with current env, moving downwards moves into further removed parents)

n
# empty
f, count, n
global scope: various funcs
# parent=None

Issue
- seems like the empty env is the one attached to the closure (outer func) and SHOULD have just a 'min' var defined
- so basically, we should be defining a var in that env when we CREATED the filter by calling the outer func. But apparently that's not happening, OR is not persisting.
- update: I *think* the empty env is actually corresponding to a while block (though would if not create a block too? maybe not). And then current_env (top row) is for the function call f(n), i.e. greaterThanX(0). So maybe mentally I've kind of been modeling envs as a linked list but it's really more of a tree, and the env where we set min=55 is in some leaf node we're not traversing.
	- another framing: maybe envs are kind of ephemeral and so we need to do something different/additional to bind args to funcs?
